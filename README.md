# Web Localization
Ideally Implemented simple web user-language localization example.

> The example doesn't work in the local environment.

## Useble
The following describes how to define the contents of the json files within the localizations folder, <br />
And this example json file is `korean.json` provided by default.
```json
{
    "undefined": "정의되지 않음",
    "hello": "안녕하세요",
    "amount": "{0}개"
}
```
